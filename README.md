# skeemas-validate
Lightweight JSON Schema valiation


## Installation
```bash
npm install skeemas-validate
```


## Usage
@TODO


## Development
Our tests are running JSON Schema test suite at [https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite](https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite). Those tests are referenced as a submodule and therefore dev setup is a little non-standard.
```bash
# clone the repo

# install dependencies from npm
npm install

# install the test suite
git submodule init
git submodule update

# run the tests
npm test
```
